Extreme heat can cause illness and death, especially among vulnerable populations who do not have as much access to self-protection strategies.

For these reasons, in my project, I hope to train a machine learning model on data of average temperatures of all the states in the country. Such data is publicly available provided by the National Centers for Environmental Information, and can be found here:
